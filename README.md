# Purwadhika Module 2 Data Analysis Capstone Project (DTIDS On Campus Batam 2024)

The following is a data analysis project that aims to uncover insights from the NYC TLC Trip Record Dataset provided by Purwadhika.

## Business Background
Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC and VeriFone Inc. are the two companies that provide taxi ride data for this analysis. The former is a company that focuses on integrated technology for the taxi and for-hire vehicle industries, whereas the latter provides technology for electronic payment transactions in many different sectors, such as finance, healthcare, and taxi media and advertising. Both companies serve a wide range of customers worldwide, as CMT Group operates in over 130 cities worldwide, whereas Verifone is a multinational corporation. The NYC TLC Trip Record dataset was primarily collected during the month of January 2023 in New York City, with CMT Group providing most of the data.

## Business Problem
Being two large providers of integrated technology in the taxi industry, both companies should identify:

1. Revenue Trends: Analyze historical revenue data to identify trends over time, such as patterns in fluctuations and peak periods.
2. Growth Patterns: Determine zones with the highest revenue growth and identify factors driving their growth.
3. Geographical Distribution: Map out the geographical distribution of revenue to pinpoint high and low-performing regions.
4. Revenue Drivers: Understand the key factors influencing revenue, such as ride frequency, trip distance, and duration of rides.
   
By understanding ride patterns and optimizing taxi fleets accordingly, both companies can ensure better vehicle utilization rates, which leads to a more streamlined taxi industry with lower operational costs. Also, by optimizing the revenue generated from taxi rides, both CMT Group and Verifone, Inc. have significant opportunities to enhance their market share in the taxi industry and other industries that they have chosen to specialize in.

## Data Analysis Goal
This analysis examines the patterns in trend, growth, and geographical distribution of revenue generated from taxi rides from the NYC TLC Trip Record Dataset provided by Purwadhika. The dataset contains data concerning ride fares, date and time of pickups and dropoffs, trip distances, and payment methods, among other taxi ride information. The analysis is done by examining the total fare amount, along with the analysis and visualization of the relationships between it and other relevant variables. For example, by uncovering insights about the relation between fare_amount, trip_distance, or minutes with total_amount, we optimize the variables that have a high correlation with the overall revenue gained from taxi rides. In other words, we aim to uncover insights on how to maximize taxi ride revenue based on its key driving factors.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
There are 3 CSV files involved in this analysis: "NYC TLC Trip Record.csv" and "taxi_zone_lookup" are the prerequisites for running "Capstone_2.ipynb", and "Capstone_2.csv" is the output of the Jupyter Notebook file. The two prerequisites are provided in this repository.
